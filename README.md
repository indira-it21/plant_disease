<h2>Introduction</h2>
Plant diseases are a major threat to food security, affecting crop yield and quality. Early and accurate detection of diseases can help in taking preventive measures. This project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images of plant leaves into healthy or diseased categories.
<h2>Features</h2>
<h4>Image classification using a trained deep learning model.</h4>
<h4>User-friendly web interface for disease prediction.</h4>
<h4>Real-time image upload and prediction.</h4>
<h4>Detailed prediction results including confidence scores</h4>
